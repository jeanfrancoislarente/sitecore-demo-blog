In this video we are using the Sitecore Demo Portal to spin up and instance of Sitecore 10.2 with the latest versions of:
  - Headless Services (20.0.0)
  - Experience Edge (20.0.0)
  - Sitecore Experience Accelerator (10.2.0)

While the video walkthrough uses the Sitecore Demo Portal, you can use any instance of Sitecore 10.2 that has a publicly available URL and the listed modules installed.

This video walkthrough focuses on the following:
  - Use the latest version of the Sitecore JSS CLI (version 20.0.3) to initialize a new JSS app
  - Configure the JSS app with SXA (item based configuration) instead of using the standard JSS app configuration (file based configuration)
  - Push JSS app items to a remote instance of Sitecore XM
  - Run and develop with your JSS app locally
  - Deploy your JSS app to Vercel and hook up editing (Experience Editor & Horizon)
  - Configure Experience Edge and switch your JSS app to query against Experience Edge
